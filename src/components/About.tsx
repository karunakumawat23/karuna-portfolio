                Hi there! I'm Karuna Kumawat, a passionate and determined beginner web developer based in the historic city of Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. My journey in technology started with curiosity and has evolved into a deep love for creating meaningful digital experiences.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Currently, I'm pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science from Shri Guru Sandipani Institute of Technology & Science, Ujjain, while simultaneously completing a Diploma in Web Development from NavGurukul, Pune. This dual approach has given me both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that I apply to every project I build.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Coming from a math background in my 12th grade from Dewas, I've always been drawn to logical problem-solving. But what truly excites me is the creative side of coding â€“ the ability to bring ideas to life through clean, simple code and meaningful design.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Although I don't have formal industry experience yet, I've built personal projects that reflect my creativity, learning mindset, and growth. My dream is to use technology to build something impactful and one day become a successful entrepreneur who creates solutions that matter.
